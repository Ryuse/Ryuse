# 👋 Hi, I'm **Ryuse**  
*Computer Science @ NUS · 🇸🇬 Based in Singapore*

I'm the indie dev behind **Idle Reincarnator**, a fantasy incremental RPG with cross-platform releases and early modding support. I’m also growing my full-stack skills through hands-on startup-style tools, CS projects, and web demos.

## 🛠 Tech Stack & Developer Skills

- **Languages**: GDScript, Java, JavaScript (vanilla/Node), HTML/CSS  
- **Tools**: GitHub Pages, GitHub Actions (for actions-streaks or dynamic mod stats), Git, Godot, SE‑EDU Java templates  
- **Developer Approach**:
  1. Build playable systems early  
  2. Collect feedback (e.g. from early players or dev communities)  
  3. Iterate based on real usage  
  4. Open the tooling/data—so others can build on it too

## 💡 Why I’m More Than a “Game Developer”

- *Completed teams & solo tools*: I’ve built full applications (like **MatchEstate**) from spec to GUI.  
- *End-to-end web dev*: Everything I’ve published lives on the web or from code-first infra (no slides or screenshots).  
- *Open & extensible*: I prioritize releasing tools/data so others can build custom mods or map visualizers—this shows I think about users **and** systems.
